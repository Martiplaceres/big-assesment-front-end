Martina Placeres, my reflection:

It was definitely one of the biggest challenges of my life. When I started the assesment I started crying, I couldn't start so I took a break( without even starting ). After that, I started making a details plan so I don't feel too overwhelmed. It helped a lot that I spent the weekend practicing and going through the lectures we had in class and writing down with my own words important details about different thing we've learned. I had difficulties with with relations and seeders so I took me more time than I expected.
I got very stuck here : "Clicking the `give heart` button updates the `hearts` property of an artwork in the database" but I'm happy I could find the solution in google(posted on REFERENCES.md file). But the most difficult part for me was: "The user sees a success message if the artwork was posted successfully ". Honestly, I was trying to use actions and reducers but I couldn't manage so I decided to make the post request from the AuctionPage.js in order to set the message and all the states together. I could not find a better way to make it work.
I forgot to commit because I was too focus on making everything work.
